Extracted Windows file for the Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android

Currently there is no way to automate extraction of the Android Intune Wrapper files. 
To enable CI integration into Azure DevOps, the extracted files are hosted here.

Note that this Repo will be used by ADO to wrap the BG CustomerInfo, BEG and Advice Field applications.

See https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-android for more details.
